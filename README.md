# Test-proficiency
This is an activity to see if I can create code that will satisfy test conditions given to me.
In order to do that, I had to create sub class using the extends keyword to take information from my main class and then create code that logs information in when a test is given. When a test is given I have to meet its requiremnets to pass it. This project really helped me get an understanding of the the "this" key word in order to set methods and properties.

This project was also to show that I can use inquirer and get the info that gets inputted into HTML that will show a team created from the classes created in inquirer.
