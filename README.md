# Test-proficiency
This is an activity to see if I can create code that will satisfy test conditions given to me.
In order to do that, I had to create sub class using the extends keyword to take information from my main class and then create code that logs information in when a test is given. When a test is given I have to meet it requiremnets to pass it. This project really helped me get an understaning of the the "this" key word in order to set methods.
